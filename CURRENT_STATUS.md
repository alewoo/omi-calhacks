# ‚úÖ FoodVoice - Current Status (WORKING)

**Last Updated:** CalHacks - Final Working Version
**Deployment:** https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run

---

## üéØ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Voice Input Processing** - Omi device sends transcripts correctly
2. **Intent Parsing** - Claude AI detects food orders with high accuracy
3. **Link Generation** - Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" links redirect to DoorDash
4. **Notifications** - Links appear prominently with "üëâ Tap to order:" format
5. **Quick Reorder** - "Order my usual" functionality working
6. **Response Time** - <3 seconds total (Claude + link generation)

### üîë Current Configuration

**Modal App:** `foodvoice-omi`
**Webhook URL:**
```
https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run/webhook/transcript
```

**API Keys (Modal Secret `foodvoice-secrets`):**
- ‚úÖ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - Working
- ‚úÖ OMI_API_KEY - Working
- ‚úÖ BRIGHT_DATA_API_KEY - Set (not currently used)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
```
User Voice ‚Üí Omi Device ‚Üí Transcript ‚Üí Modal Webhook
    ‚Üì
Claude AI Parsing (intent extraction)
    ‚Üì
Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" Link Generation
    ‚Üì
Omi Notification with Clickable Link
```

### Key Components

**1. Intent Parser ([modal_app.py:115-216](backend/modal_app.py))**
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Extracts: food_item, restaurant, cuisine, dietary_restrictions
- Strong trigger phrases required: "order food", "order a", "order me", etc.
- Confidence scoring (0-1)

**2. DoorDash Finder ([modal_app.py:77-113](backend/modal_app.py))**
- Generates Google search links with `&btnI=1` (I'm Feeling Lucky)
- Format: `https://www.google.com/search?q={restaurant}+DoorDash&btnI=1`
- Automatically redirects to correct DoorDash page
- Fallback: Generic DoorDash homepage

**3. Transcript Processing ([modal_app.py:61-66](backend/modal_app.py))**
- Extracts ALL segments (not just `is_user=True`)
- Fixed issue where Omi marks everything as `is_user=False`

## üìã Testing Commands

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Test Food Order
```bash
curl -X POST https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run/webhook/transcript \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test123",
    "segments": [{
      "text": "Order a pepperoni pizza from Dominos",
      "speaker": "User",
      "speaker_id": 0,
      "is_user": true,
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 2.5
    }]
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "order": {
    "food_item": "pepperoni pizza",
    "restaurant": "Dominos",
    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=Dominos+DoorDash&btnI=1",
  "message": "üçï pepperoni pizza from Dominos\n\nüëâ Tap to order: https://www.google.com/..."
}
```

### View Live Logs
```bash
modal app logs foodvoice-omi

## üé§ Voice Commands That Work

### Basic Order
> "Order a pepperoni pizza"

### Specific Restaurant
> "Order a burger from Five Guys"

### Cuisine Type
> "Order Chinese food"

### Quick Reorder
> "Order my usual"

---

## üîß Recent Fixes (Session Summary)

### Issue 1: Empty Transcripts (is_user=False)
**Problem:** Omi marked all user speech as `is_user=False`, causing transcript extraction to return empty string.

**Fix:** Changed `get_user_text()` to extract ALL segments:
```python
def get_user_text(self) -> str:
    # Get ALL text, not just is_user=True
    return " ".join([s.text for s in self.segments])
```

### Issue 2: Broken DoorDash Links (404 Errors)
**Problem:** Direct DoorDash URLs like `/search/?query=...` returned 404 errors.

**Solution:** Switched to Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" links that auto-redirect:
```python
lucky_link = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_query}&btnI=1"
```

### Issue 3: Link Not Clickable in Notifications
**Problem:** Links weren't prominent enough in Omi notifications.

**Fix:** Improved formatting with clear call-to-action:
```python
response_message = f"üçï {summary}\n\nüëâ Tap to order: {deep_link}"
```

## üö´ What We Tried But Didn't Work

### Bright Data Browser Automation
- **Attempted:** Real-time web scraping with Playwright
- **Issue:** 30+ second timeouts, too slow for webhook responses
- **Error:** `Timeout 30000ms exceeded`
- **Decision:** Abandoned in favor of fast Google links

### Bright Data HTTP Proxy
- **Attempted:** Using Bright Data zone as HTTP proxy
- **Issue:** Zone type mismatch (Scraping Browser ‚â† Proxy)
- **Error:** `403 You are trying to use Scraping Browser zone as regular proxy`
- **Decision:** Not compatible with current setup

---

## üì± Omi App Configuration

### Correct Setup (VERIFIED WORKING)
```
App Name: FoodVoice
Trigger: Transcript Processed (NOT Audio Bytes)
Webhook URL: https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run/webhook/transcript
```

**Critical:** Must use "Transcript Processed" trigger. "Audio Bytes" sends binary audio data that the backend cannot parse.

---

## üé¨ Demo Ready

### 60-Second Script

**Setup (5 sec):**
*Hold up Omi device*
> "I have the Omi DevKit 2 paired and ready."

**Demo 1: Voice Order (25 sec):**
*Say to device:* "Order a burger from Five Guys"
*Show Modal logs on laptop*
> "Watch the logs - it heard my voice, detected the food order, sent to Claude AI, and generated a Google link that redirects to DoorDash!"

**Demo 2: Show Notification (15 sec):**
*Show phone with notification*
> "Clean notification with one-tap ordering. The link automatically takes you to Five Guys on DoorDash."

**Demo 3: Quick Reorder (15 sec):**
*Say:* "Order my usual"
> "It remembered my last order! Perfect for busy people."
