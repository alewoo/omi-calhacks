# Current Test Status

## What I Just Discovered

You changed the Omi app trigger to "Transcript Processed" ‚úÖ

But there are **TWO PROBLEMS**:

### Problem 1: Omi App Still Sending Binary Audio

The logs show your Omi device is STILL sending binary audio data (not text transcripts). This means either:
- The trigger change hasn't taken effect yet
- You need to **restart the Omi mobile app**
- Or the device needs to be re-paired

### Problem 2: Claude AI Not Detecting Food Orders

When I test with pure text like "Order a pepperoni pizza", the backend receives it correctly BUT Claude returns "no food order detected".

Logs show:
```
‚úì Food order trigger detected  ‚Üê Keyword matching works!
‚ÑπÔ∏è No food order detected in: Order a pepperoni pizza from Dominos  ‚Üê Claude says no food??
```

This is weird because the prompt explicitly asks Claude to parse food orders.

## What You Need To Do NOW

### Step 1: Fix Omi App (Binary Audio Issue)

**On your phone:**
1. Force quit the Omi mobile app (swipe up and close it completely)
2. Re-open the Omi app
3. Verify your FoodVoice app shows **"Transcript Processed"** as the trigger
4. Try speaking to your Omi device: "Order a pizza"

### Step 2: Check If It's Working

After restarting the app, test by saying:
> "Order a pepperoni pizza"

Then check the logs:
```bash
modal app logs foodvoice-omi
```

Look for:
- `üìù Transcript: Order a pepperoni pizza` (not binary data)
- `‚úì Food order trigger detected`
- `üçï Order intent detected: pepperoni pizza`

## If Still Not Working...

The Claude API might be having issues OR the model name might be wrong. Let me know and I'll:
1. Test the Claude API directly
2. Check if the prompt needs adjustment
3. Verify the API key is working

## Quick Status Check

Run this command to test if the backend can receive TEXT:
```bash
curl -X POST https://alexwang409--foodvoice-omi-fastapi-app.modal.run/webhook/transcript \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id":"manual-test",
    "segments":[{
      "text":"Order a large pepperoni pizza",
      "speaker":"User",
      "speaker_id":0,
      "is_user":true,
      "start":0.0,
      "end":1.5
    }]
  }'
```

Expected response (currently broken):
```json
{"status":"no_intent"}
```

Should be (when fixed):
```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Order confirmed! ..."
}
```

**Next Action:** Force quit and restart Omi mobile app, then test with your device.
