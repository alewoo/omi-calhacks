## 5. Debugging Tips

### If "no_intent" Response

**Check Modal logs first!** This will tell you exactly what's happening.

Go to: https://modal.com/apps/alexwang409/main/deployed/foodvoice-omi

Look for:
- "‚ö†Ô∏è No food keywords found" ‚Üí Intent parser didn't recognize food words
- "‚ùå Error parsing intent" ‚Üí Claude API issue
- "‚úì Matched keywords" ‚Üí Good! Intent was detected

### If Claude API Errors

Check your Modal secret has the correct API key:
```bash
modal secret list
```

Should show `foodvoice-secrets`

### If No Response at All

1. Check webhook URL is correct in Omi app
2. Verify device is connected and speaking
3. Check Modal logs for any requests coming in
